Description: The 'midasml' package implements estimation and prediction methods for high-dimensional mixed-frequency (MIDAS) time-series and panel data regression models. The regularized MIDAS models are estimated using orthogonal (e.g. Legendre) polynomials and sparse-group LASSO (sg-LASSO) estimator. For more information on the 'midasml' approach see Babii, Ghysels, and Striaukas (2021, JBES forthcoming) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2021.1899933>. The package is equipped with the fast implementation of the sg-LASSO estimator by means of proximal block coordinate descent. High-dimensional mixed frequency time-series data can also be easily manipulated with functions provided in the package.
